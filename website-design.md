Please refer to the [contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the general flow of this project and procedure for sending pull
requests.

The website is generated using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## jekyll

The site is published from the [docs/
directory](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/tree/master/docs)
using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The frameworks used
are [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) and [Font
Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Code style

Try to be as consistent as possible. When using Jekyll, the html is
sometimes split across several files so it can be challenging to get
perfect indentation. The general rule is 2 space indentation; however,
right now we have no regular web devs working on this project, so if
you would like to recommend another style or have other suggestions
regarding the website, please let us know by opening an issue for
discussion.

### Markdown

Much of the jekyll part of the web site uses [GitHub
markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
For certain areas where style is applied, html is used.
